## Variants and Best Pratices

Use stickers to visually identify elements in a dataset that are part of the same group. Stickers can be any color.

<Sticker />

### Colors

You can use stickers with the following colors using [`displayType`](#api-displayType) property:

<StickerColors />

### Sizes

Also, you can use the following sizes on your Sticker just setting up [`size`](#api-size):

<StickerSizes />

### Position

You can set a desired alignment of sticker according to a parent element, just set up the [`position`](#api-position) property.

<StickerPositions />

### Outside

If you want to set the position of the sticker on the outside corners, use [`outside`](#api-outside) property in conjunction with [`position`](#api-position) property like the following example:

<StickerOutside />

### Overlay

Overlay content over stickers by nesting `sticker-overlay` elements as children of ClaySticker.

<StickerOverlay />

### User Icon

If you want to use a ClaySticker as User Icon add `sticker-user-icon` on className of the `ClaySticker` component like the example below:

<StickerUserIcon />
