## Variants and Best Pratices

### Default

This pattern is completely different from a dropdown. A selector is a native component with a data provider. A dropdown, however, opens a panel that could contain multiple and different natural elements.

Use `ClaySelect.Option` for wrapping an option item.

<Select />

### SelectWithOption

If you use ClaySelect only for simple cases that do not need props for [`options`](#api-options), you can use `<ClaySelectWithOption />` which will have the same result as the previous version.

<SelectWithOption />

## API

### Select and Select.Option Variants

These components don't have an API. Use the same attributes of a `<select>` element for `ClaySelect` and the same attributes of a `<option>` element for `ClaySelect.Option` variant.

### SelectWithOption
