#Architectural Decision Records

An architectural decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

In order to create a new ADR, copy and paste from [TEMPLATE](./TEMPLATE.md) and start a new ADR file. If you have any images needed in the ADR, please put them in the [images folder](./images).

For a general overview of this idea, see the [architecture_decision_record repo](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record).
